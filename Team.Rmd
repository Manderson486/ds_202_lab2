## Team Documentation

This is the work on the choco lab from Marcella Anderson, Caitlin Fordell, and Mario Lloyd Galvao-Wilson

### Problem 1

```{r}
##Problem 1
hist(choco$Rating, xlab = "Chocolate Rating", main = "Histogram of Chocolate Rating")
```

The histogram of chocolate ratings is unimodal and skewed to the left with a center around 3.25 and outliers around 1, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.

```{r}
boxplot(choco$Rating, main = "Boxplot of Chocolate Rating", ylab = "Rating")
```


The boxplot shows a median around 3.25, the 25th percentile at around 3, and the 75th percentile at 3.75. The boxplot also shows outliers at 1, 1.5, 1.75, and 2 but does not tell how many are at each point.


### Problem 2

```{r}
lvlChoc <- levels(choco$Location) #defines the levels
typeChoc <- factor(choco$Location, lvlChoc) #defines the factor using the levels

counts <- table(choco$Location)

plt <- barplot(counts, col='steelblue', xaxt="n")
text(plt, par("usr")[3], labels = lvlChoc, srt = 60, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=0.7) 

```


### Problem 3
```{r}
##Problem 3
##Plotting cocoa percent and rating
plot(x = choco$Rating, y = choco$Cocoa_Percent, xlab = "Rating", ylab = "Cocoa Percent", main = "Cocoa Percent vs. Chocolate Rating")
```

The graph shows that the lowest ratings were given to the chocolates with a higher cocoa percent. The highest ratings were given to chocolates with about 60 to 80% cocoa. There are outliers that were given ratings of 1 and 1.5. 

```{r}
##Problem 3
plot(x = choco$Cocoa_Percent, y = choco$Rating, xlab = "Cocoa Percent", ylab = "Rating", main = "Cocoa Percent vs. Chocolate Rating")
```
There appears to be a negative trend between the rating and the percent of cocoa. As cocoa percent increases, ratings tend to decrease. 

```{r}
##Problem 3
##finding correlation between cocoa percent and rating
cor(x = choco$Cocoa_Percent, y = choco$Rating)
```

There is a weak, negative relationship between cocoa percent and chocolate rating. 


### Problem 4


```{r}
lvlOrig <- levels(choco$Bean_Origin)
typeOrig <- factor(choco$Bean_Origin, lvlOrig)


boxplot(choco$Rating ~ typeOrig,  las=2)

summary(typeOrig)

```

### Problem 5

First we looked at the different reviews and ratings over time

```{r}
##Problem 5
##histogram of review date
hist(choco$Date, xlab = "Review Date", main = "Histogram of Review Date")
```
Most of the reviews seemed to have been taken around 2014, and the company seemed take less reviews in 2016 and 2020. 

```{r}
##Problem 3 or 5
##creating a histogram of rating
hist(choco$Rating, xlab = "Rating", main = "Histogram of Rating")
```

The most popular ratings were 2.75 and 3.5, and there appear to be outliers of ratings at 1, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.
